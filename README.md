Make continuous deployment safe by comparing before and after webpage 
screenshots for each release. Depicted shows when any visual, perceptual 
differences are found. This is the ultimate, automated end-to-end test.

### API Reference

All of these requests are POSTs with URL-encoded or multipart/form-data bodies 
and require HTTP Basic Authentication using your API key as the username and 
secret as the password. All responses are JSON. The 'success' key will be 
present in all responses and true if the request was successful. If 'success'
isn't present, a human-readable error message may be present in the response 
under the key 'error'.

#### /api/request_run

Requests a new run for a release candidate. Causes the API system to take screenshots and do pdiffs. When `ref_url` and `ref_config` are supplied, the system will run two sets of captures (one for the baseline, one for the new release) and then compare them. When `rel_url` and `ref_config` are not specified, the last good run for this build is found and used for comparison.

##### Parameters

    <dd>ID of the build.</dd>
    <dt>release_name</dt>
    <dd>Name of the release.</dd>

    <dd>URL of the baseline to request as a run.</dd>
    <dt>ref_config</dt>
    <dd>JSON data that is the config for the baseline of the new run.</dd>
</dl>

###### Format of `config`

The config passed to the `request_run` function may have any or all of these fields. All fields are optional and have reasonably sane defaults.

```json
